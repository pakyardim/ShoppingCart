        <p>
          <strong>MARSÜT Wholesale Milk and Foodstuffs Trade</strong> was
          established in 1982 to offer healthy and reliable products to its
          customers. In those years, only "Kashar Cheese" was brought from Kars
          region and marketed in Bursa. Since 1992, it has added white cheese
          and its varieties to our product range in order to deliver more
          varieties to our valued customers. With your support, we are proud to
          be a sought-after brand in our region for its variety and quality
          standards. All of our packaged products are produced with the
          permissions of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
